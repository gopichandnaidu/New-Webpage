        <h2 class="title">PAN CARD TAMPERING DETECTION</h2><br/>
        <h3 class="heading">ABSTRACT:</h3>
        <p class="para">The Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card is an important document that serves as an identification tool for many more purposes like tax payment, verification medium in banks, companies and in other government services in India. However, with the increasing demand for PAN Cards, fraudulent activities involving fake PAN Cards have also increased. For this project we will calculate the structural similarity of the original PAN card and the PAN card uploaded by the user. This is the soul of this project. Similarly in this project with the help of image processing involving the techniques of computer vision we are going to detect that whether the given image of the PAN card is original or tampered (fake) PAN card.</p>
        <h3 class="heading">01.INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p class="para">The Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card is a very important document for taxpayers in India, as it provides a unique identification number for various financial transactions. However, the increasing demand for PAN Cards has led to an increase in fraudulent activities involving fake PAN Cards, which can be used for tax fraud and other financial crimes. As such, it is essential to have a system in place to detect fake and real PAN Cards. For this project we will calculate the structural similarity of the original PAN card and the PAN card uploaded by the user. This is the soul of this project. Similarly in this project with the help of image processing involving the techniques of computer vision we are going to detect that whether the given image of the PAN card is original or tampered (fake) PAN card.The PAN card is a vital identification document issued by the Income Tax Department of India and is primarily used for tax-related purposes. It contains important personal and financial information, including the individual's name, date of birth, photograph, and a unique alphanumeric PAN number.The act of tampering with a PAN card can involve various forms of forgery, alteration, or unauthorized changes to the card's details. Pan card tampering is illegal and unethical, and those who engage in such activities may face severe legal consequences.</p>

        <p class="para">This project can be used in different organizations where customers or users need to provide any kind of id in order to get themselves verified. The organization can use this project to find out whether the ID is original or fake. Similarly, this can be used for any type of ID like Aadhar, voter id, etc..In conclusion, the development and implementation of a Pan Card Tampering Detection system represent a significant stride towards safeguarding the integrity of Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards and the vital information they hold. This innovative system leverages advanced technologies, including image processing and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), to provide a robust and efficient solution for detecting alterations and tampering attempts in PAN cards.</p><br/>
        <h1 class="main">FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS</h1>
        <p class="para">Further enhancements can be providing the new futures of the pan card so that a peoples can find the card is real or fake through it and also converting our application into a mobile app. This makes it even much better and easier to access from anyplace and anytime. Also some extra features can be added such as credit/debit card detection, fake id detection etc.<br/>
            Certainly, here are potential future enhancements for the Pan Card Tampering Detection Project using SSIM:<br/>
            In the future, the project can be extended to offer real-time PAN card verification, allowing users to capture PAN card images using their device's camera for immediate analysis. This real-time capability can be particularly valuable for online identity verification services and applications where quick and accurate authentication is essential.
