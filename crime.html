        <h2 class="title">CRIME TYPE AND OCCURRENCE PREDICTION</h2><br/>
        <h3 class="heading">ABSTRACT:</h3>
        <p class="para">In contemporary society, criminal activities have emerged as a significant concern for individuals and communities, leading to a disruption in the overall fabric of a nation. Understanding crime patterns is essential in order to effectively investigate and respond to such criminal behaviors. This research project focuses on identifying the most prevalent types of crimes, as well as the timing and location of occurrence. By utilizing machine learning algorithms such as KNN and K-Means, we have successfully classified various crime patterns with a high degree of accuracy compared to previous studies. Data mining and machine learning techniques play a crucial role in the detection and prevention of crimes. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different data mining methods in analyzing historical crime data. By comparing and contrasting various data mining techniques, including gender, age, occupation status, and crime location, we can determine their effectiveness in crime analysis and prevention.The examination of the data indicated that the "Random Forest classifier" demonstrated better performance in comparison to alternative methods. This inference was made after considering different performance metrics such as instance classification accuracy, precision, recall, and overall accuracy. It is clear that data mining methods are crucial in forecasting and deterring criminal activities.</p>
        <h3 class="heading">01.INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p class="para">Misconduct poses a significant threat that is increasing in terms of severity. Any action that violates government laws and is highly detrimental is considered a wrongdoing. Analyzing misconduct patterns involves examining various aspects of criminology and identifying trends. The government invests time and effort in implementing technology to combat criminal activities. Utilizing machine learning techniques and data sets is essential for predicting types and patterns of crimes. By analyzing existing crime data, it is possible to forecast the type and occurrence of crimes based on location and time. Researchers have conducted numerous studies to analyze crime patterns and their correlations in specific areas. Identifying hotspots has streamlined the categorization of crime patterns, enabling authorities to address them more effectively. This approach utilizes a dataset from Kaggle open source, considering various factors, time, and location over a specific period. A classification calculation is utilized to choose the sort of wrongdoing and hotspots of criminal works out at specific times and days. The proposed technique incorporates executing a machine learning calculation to recognize planning criminal plans based on common and spatial data. A wrongdoing is a consider act that can cause physical or mental harmed, as well as property hurt or event, and can lead to educated by a state or other proficient concurring to the reality of the wrongdoing. The number and shapes of criminal works out are intensifying at an bothering rate, obliging working circumstances to make imperative strategies to take preventive measures. In the current circumstance of rapidly extending wrongdoing, orchestrate crime-solving techniques are unable to pass on comes around, being energize paced and less useful. In this way, if we can come up with ways to anticipate wrongdoing, in detail, a few time as of late it happens, or come up with a “machine” that can offer offer offer assistance police officers, it would lift the burden of police and offer offer offer help in keeping up a vital separate from wrongdoings. To fulfill this, we propose checking machine learning (ML) and computer vision calculations and strategies.The data gotten is to start with pre-processed utilizing machine learning strategy channel and wrapper in orchestrate to empty immaterial and repeated data values. It besides diminishes the dimensionality in this way the data has been cleaned. The data is at that point help encounters a portion plan. It is classified into test and arranged data set. The appear is arranged by dataset both planning and testing .It is at that point taken after by mapping. The wrongdoing sort, year, month, time, date, put are mapped to an numbers for ensuring classification less requesting. The free affect between the properties are analyzed at to begin with by utilizing Naïve Bayes. Bernoulli Naïve Bayes is utilized for classifying the independent highlights removed. The wrongdoing highlights are named that licenses to analyze the occasion of wrongdoing at a particular time and zone. At final, the wrongdoing which happen the most along with spatial and temporal information is picked up. The execution of the figure illustrate is found out by calculating accuracy rate. The tongue utilized in arranging the figure illustrate is python and run on the Collab – an online compiler for data examination and machine learning models.</p>
        <h3 class="heading">1.1MOTIVATION:</h3>
        <h4>1.1.1 OVERVIEW OF EXISTING SYSTEM:</h4><br/>
        <p class="para2">Decision tree has been used in the factor of finding crime patterns and also extracting the features from large amount of data is inclusive. It provides a primary structure for further classification process. The classified crime patterns are feature extracted using Deep Neural network. The crime prediction helps in forecasting the future happening of any type of criminal activities. </p>
        <h4>Drawbacks of existing system:</h4><br/>
        <p class="para2">1. The pre-existing works account for low accuracy since the classifier uses a categorical values which produces a biased outcome for the nominal attributes with greater value.<br/>
            2. The classification techniques does not suited for regions with inappropriate data and real valued attributes. <br/>
            3. The value of the classifier must be tuned and hence there is a need of assigning an optimal value.
            </p>
        <h4>1.1.2 OVERVIEW OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:</h4><br/>
        <p class="para2">The data obtained is first pre-processed using machine learning technique filter and wrapper in order to remove irrelevant and repeated data values. It also reduces the dimensionality thus the data has been cleaned. The data is then further undergoes a splitting process. It is classified into test and trained data set. The model is trained by dataset both training and testing .It is then followed by mapping. The crime type, year, month, time, date, place are mapped to an integer for ensuring classification easier. The independent effect between the attributes are analyzed initially by using Naïve Bayes. Bernoulli Naïve Bayes is used for classifying the independent features extracted. The crime features are labelled that allows to analyze the occurrence of crime at a particular time and location. Finally, the crime which occur the most along with spatial and temporal information is gained. The performance of the prediction model is found out by calculating accuracy rate. The language used in designing the prediction model is python and run on the Collab – an online compiler for data analysis and machine learning models.</p>
        <h4>Advantages of proposed system:</h4><br/>
        <p class="para2">1. The proposed algorithm is well suited for the crime pattern detection since most of the featured attributes depends on the time and location.<br/>
            2. It also overcomes the problem of analyzing independent effect of the attributes. <br/>
            3. The initialization of optimal value is not required since it accounts for real valued, nominal value and also concern the region with insufficient information.<br/>
            4. The accuracy has been relatively high when compared to other machine learning prediction model.

        <h3 class="heading">1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h3>
        <p class="para">In the current scenario of rapidly increasing crime, traditional crime-solving techniques are unable to deliver results, being slow paced and less efficient. Thus, if we can come up with ways to predict crime, in detail, before it occurs, or come up with a software that can assist police officers, it would lift the burden of police and help in preventing crimes..</p>
